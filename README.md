# Movie App
An Android app designed to consume the MovieDB. This was developed as part of the Android Nanodegree at Udacity.

In order to run and debug this app, first you need to define your MOVIE DB API KEY.

In order to get an API KEY, follow this [link](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

After you've done that, fill the black space ```'""'``` of the ```MOVIE_DB_API_KEY``` propertie, in the app's build.gradle, with you API KEY.

Enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š
